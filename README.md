# job4j_design

Hello, my friend! Back in 2000, I got interested in programming, but then I was young and resisted the voice of my heart.
Twenty years after, having a completely different profession, increasing the degree of awareness,
I recalled what I really wanted. And here I am now! For a year now, I've been gaining knowledge and 
I really like it! Every day I'm getting stronger, smarter
and more promising! I'm sure I'll become a professional in this interesting and overwhelming sphere!

`Level 1` : `Java SE, ООП`

`Level 2` : `Data structures and algorithms, input-output, SQL, JDBC, Garbage Collection, OOD `
